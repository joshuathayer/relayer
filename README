relayer - a simple audio delay

Joe Buck and the FOX announcers are awful, and the KNBR radio guys are
great. FOX's 45 second delay makes it almost impossible to listen to the 
radio while watching the TV, however. So, this small hack to buffer some
seconds of audio.

The window being buffered is adjustable while running using the 'a' and 
'z' keys. 'a' will increase the amount being buffered, 'z' will decrease.

Playback seems to be a bit choppy sometimes. And my AM radio sucks.

REQUIREMENTS

relayer requires Audio::PortAudio, which requires libportaudio2.
